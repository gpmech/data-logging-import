Data Logging Import
===================

The aim of Data Logging Import is to import data 
from multiple sources into a single standard 
format. This is needed because there are several
data-logging formats (AiM, RaceChrono, MoTeC, 
Magneti Marelli, GoPro, etc.) and little 
interoperability between them. This package 
attempts to import data from many sources and 
provide quick and easy access to analysis with
standard Python tools.
